# dft_scripts
 I have developed some DFT and Multiscale Simulation Scripts to facilitate my life. It might help you as well ! ;)


1. js_charge_diff.py - This script plots the valence charge difference using the output of a bader analysis and POSCAR from VASP code.

2. jlxps_builder scripts - Do you need to acquire half-core eigenenergies from VASP and convolve these discrete signals with gaussians to compare C1s and N1s theoretical signals with experimental X-ray Photoelectron spectra? I have developed some tecniques to facilitate the whole thing. These scripts were built to some of my issues, however, it does not include corrections with potentials. Please, read the README.md file before trying. There is an example using a charged Ruthenium complex [RuII-OH2]. The next upgrade will have more comments and explanations.
